# üìä NIFTY 50 Intraday Dataset for Reinforcement Learning in Trading

This repository provides training and test datasets curated from the NIFTY 50 index for research and experimentation in algorithmic trading using reinforcement learning models such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN).

## üìÅ Dataset Files

- `Nifty50_train.csv`: Preprocessed dataset for training models.
- `Nifty50_test.csv`: Corresponding test dataset used for evaluation.

## üìà Data Description

Each row in the dataset represents a 15-minute intraday candle and contains the following columns:

- `date`: Date of the record
- `time`: Time of the candle (IST)
- `close`: Closing price
- `open`: Opening price
- `high`: Highest price during the interval
- `low`: Lowest price during the interval
- `pivot`: Pivot point (average of high, low, and close for the candle)
- `200_EMA`: 200-period Exponential Moving Average
- `Supertrend(12,3)`: Supertrend indicator with period 12 and multiplier 3
- `Supertrend(11,2)`: Supertrend indicator with period 11 and multiplier 2
- `Supertrend(10,1)`: Supertrend indicator with period 10 and multiplier 1

## üîç Use Case

These datasets were used in experiments involving Deep Reinforcement Learning models (DQN variants) to evaluate trading strategies on the NIFTY 50 index.
